Library Management System

You have to design a Library management system for your company.
The employees can get different types of books issued from library.
There are three types of books available in the library.

All the books can be issued for 7 days only.

	1. Data Analytics – The late fee is Rs 5 per day.
	2. Technology – The late fee is Rs 6 per day.
	3. Management – The late fee is Rs 7 per day.

The application should provide “Return Book” functionality.

Assumptions –
	1. Date api can be used.
	2. Return date can be taken as today’s date by default.

Instructions –
For return book, the application should
	1. Take input as employee details, type of book to be returned and issue date of that book.
	2. Based on number of days between issue date and today’s date, if the employee is late in returning the book then calculate late fee as per the rules mentioned with type of book else late fee will be 0.
	3. For the positive case when employee is not late in returning the book, print the message as “There is no late fee applicable and the book has been returned”.
	4. Display the details with the following information.
		· Name of Employee
		· Type of Book
		· Issue Date
		· Return Date
		· Late Fee
	5. Show the output on the console.
	6. Throw custom exception with appropriate message if issue date entered is after the today’s date.
		Example – Issue date is 16-Jun-2015 and today’s date is 14-Jun-2015.
	7. Handle appropriate exceptions with meaningful messages whenever required.
	8. Usage of database required for this application.
	9. The design should be flexible enough so that in future, more type of books or new functionality can be added.
